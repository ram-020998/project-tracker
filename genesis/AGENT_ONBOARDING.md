# Genesis — Agent Onboarding & Reference ("the bible") — INDEX

> **This is the bible index.** The Genesis bible is the single, task-agnostic source of truth that brings any agent
> session fully up to speed on Genesis and defines every practice you must follow. It has been **split into functional
> chunks** under [`bible/`](./bible/) so that agents can find + update the right part without wrestling a 1,300-line file.
> **Splitting changed the packaging, NOT the authority: the bible is still one document — read + obey all of it.**
>
> ## ⛔ MANDATORY — what "read the bible" means
> When the human says **"read the bible"** (or points you at `AGENT_ONBOARDING.md`), you MUST:
> 1. Read **this index**, then
> 2. Read **every chunk listed in the manifest below, in order** — not just the one that looks relevant. The chunks are
>    interdependent (architecture ↔ ADRs ↔ lessons ↔ the loop); skipping any means you will violate a constraint you
>    never read.
> 3. Then **follow all of it religiously** for the rest of the session — the ADRs (§5) and working agreements (§8/§10)
>    are non-negotiable; the lessons (§7) are do-not-regress.
>
> After reading, briefly **restate** the architecture + current state + the non-negotiables, then do the work the human
> gives you following the loop in `bible/07-working-on-tasks-and-agreements.md` (§8). **This document assigns no task.**
>
> **Last refreshed: 2026-08-18 — latest SHIPPED: genesis v0.48.7 + genesis-workflows v0.9.5 + genesis-core v0.9.3 +
> kiro-agent-sdk v0.7.0 + genesis-appian-parser v0.2.0.** (Full phase/release banner + version detail live in
> `bible/00-onboarding-and-overview.md` and `bible/01-current-state.md`.)

## 📚 The bible manifest (read all, in this order)

| # | Chunk | Original § | What it holds — why you read it |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | [`bible/00-onboarding-and-overview.md`](./bible/00-onboarding-and-overview.md) | header + §0 + §1 | Purpose + how to keep the bible current; the phase/release banner; **what Genesis is** (one paragraph); the **onboarding read-order** (which design docs + code to read before touching an area). **Start here.** |
| 1 | [`bible/01-current-state.md`](./bible/01-current-state.md) | §2 | **Current state** — the five-repo tag table, dependency chain, test counts, milestones, and "what works today". *Changes every release.* |
| 2 | [`bible/02-architecture.md`](./bible/02-architecture.md) | §3 | **Architecture / mental model** — layered design (agents never orchestrate), the reliability trio, state/blackboard rule, subprocess-worker execution, the SQLite data plane, HITL modes, release/versioning. |
| 3 | [`bible/03-codebase-map.md`](./bible/03-codebase-map.md) | §4 | **Codebase map** — where every module lives across genesis-core / genesis / genesis-workflows / kiro-agent-sdk / genesis-appian-parser. |
| 4 | [`bible/04-adrs-and-constraints.md`](./bible/04-adrs-and-constraints.md) | §5 | **Non-negotiable constraints** — ADR-001..047 + key implementation contracts. **Do not violate; flag + confirm if a task requires it.** |
| 5 | [`bible/05-dev-loop-and-release.md`](./bible/05-dev-loop-and-release.md) | §6 | **Environment, dev loop, release, CI** — the venv, how to run tests/app, the versioning/tag/push protocol, CI, npm/gitignore gotchas. |
| 6 | [`bible/06-hard-won-lessons.md`](./bible/06-hard-won-lessons.md) | §7 | **Hard-won lessons** — concrete bugs + root causes you must not regress. *Grows often.* |
| 7 | [`bible/07-working-on-tasks-and-agreements.md`](./bible/07-working-on-tasks-and-agreements.md) | §8 + §10 | **The work loop** (understand→verify→scope→test→gates→release→document→report) + the **working agreements** (honest pushback, ask before destructive actions, keep scope tight). |
| 8 | [`bible/08-roadmap-and-backlog.md`](./bible/08-roadmap-and-backlog.md) | §9 | **Roadmap & backlog** — the shipped-phase as-builts (context) + what is next. *Largest; grows every phase.* |

Adjacent authoritative folders (referenced throughout the chunks): [`specs/`](./specs/) (per-phase plans + `specs/backlog/` deferred work + `specs/bugs/` filed defects), [`progress/`](./progress/) (as-built records), [`reference/`](./reference/) (decision-log/ADRs, coding-standards, taxonomies), [`spike/`](./spike/), [`tracker.md`](./tracker.md) (§6 status log = running history).

## 🔁 Cross-reference map (§N → chunk)

The chunks preserve the original section numbers, so references inside them like *"see §7"* / *"per §2"* still resolve.
Use this map:

- **§0** What Genesis is → chunk 00 · **§1** How to onboard → chunk 00
- **§2** Current state → chunk 01
- **§3** Architecture → chunk 02
- **§4** Codebase map → chunk 03
- **§5** ADRs / constraints → chunk 04
- **§6** Environment / dev loop / release / CI → chunk 05
- **§7** Hard-won lessons → chunk 06
- **§8** The work loop → chunk 07 · **§10** Working agreements → chunk 07
- **§9** Roadmap & backlog → chunk 08

## ✍️ Keeping the bible current (part of Definition of Done)

When tags, architecture, ADRs, or hard-won lessons change, update the **specific chunk** (not a monolith) and this
index's "Last refreshed" stamp. Routing:

- **A release** (new tag / version / test counts / "what works") → `bible/01-current-state.md` (§2) + this index's
  Last-refreshed line + the release banner in `bible/00-onboarding-and-overview.md`.
- **A new/changed ADR** → `bible/04-adrs-and-constraints.md` (§5) — and mirror the decision in `reference/decision-log.md`.
- **A new hard-won lesson** → `bible/06-hard-won-lessons.md` (§7).
- **A new module / moved code** → `bible/03-codebase-map.md` (§4).
- **A roadmap/phase change** → `bible/08-roadmap-and-backlog.md` (§9).
- **A change to the process/loop or working agreements** → `bible/07-working-on-tasks-and-agreements.md` (§8/§10).

Rules for editing a chunk: **keep it verbatim-faithful — never summarize away or drop existing content when adding an
entry** (the intelligence of the bible is the accumulated detail). Append/refine in place. If you add a NEW chunk, add a
row to the manifest above and to the §→chunk map. Then push project-tracker (`git pull --rebase` → push) per §6.
